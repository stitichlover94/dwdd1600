        <h1>Newborns</h1>
         <p>A <strong>puppy</strong> is a juvenile dog, or in simple terms a baby dog. A dog is considered a puppy typically around the first 12-18 months of their lives, with some variation that depends on breed, size, and personality. Usually smaller dog breeds tend to develop and reach maturity sooner, both physically and emotionally than larger breeds of dogs. Some larger breeds of dogs can take up to almost 24 months to reach adulthood.</p>
            <p>Puppies typically weigh in around 1-1.5 kg (2.2-3.3 lb), with some larger puppies weighing up to 7-11 kg (15-24 lb). Typically, a healthy puppy grows quickly after birth with the help of their mother or with human care. Puppies display physical changes with not just with growth but in some breeds of dogs a puppy's coat color may change as a puppy grows older, as in the case of the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Terrier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yorkshire Terrier</a>. </p>

            <h2>Prenatal Development</h2>
            <p>Like all animals alike, and even us humans, Dogs go through prenatal development before they are born. These are all of the stages to prenatal development, which are:</p>
              <ol>
            <li><strong>The Germinal Stage</strong> - Starts at fertilization and lasts about 2 weeks.</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>The Embryonic Stage</strong> - At this stage many important organs and body systems start to develop such as the heart, brain, lungs, and digestive system. This stage takes place at about 2-4 weeks of pregnancy.</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>The Fetal Stage</strong> - During this final stage, the puppy's organs and body systems continue to develop more. In this period, the puppy gains the ability to control their own body tempature, as well as the maturing of their senses such as hearing and sight. This stage lasts from about day 28 of pregnancy to day 63, when the puppy is about to exit their mother's womb. </li>
                 
                  <li><strong>The Birthing Stage</strong> - The last stage of development, in which the mother dog goes into labour which begins when the mother dog recieves contractions. This period lasts on average about 3-12 hours, with most dogs being able to give birth within 6 hours. This stage never takes longer than a day.</li>    
            </ol>

            <h2>After Birth</h2>
            <p>On average of 63 days of pregnancy, Puppies are born and emerge in an <em>amnion</em>, a membrane that is bitten off and eaten by the mother dog. Puppies start to nurse almost immediately after they are born. However, a problem may arise as typically female dogs only have enough to feed six puppies, if the litter exceeds that amount, usually one or two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runts</a> could use some help in getting their proper <a href="diet.html#nutrients">nutrients</a>. In this situation, human intervention may need to take place, by hand-feeding the stronger dogs, so the weaker runts are able to feed of their mother.</p>
            
            <p>In the beggining of puppies life, they spend a majority of their time sleeping and rest feeding. This is so they can gain strength and grow healthy. Puppies are born with a fully developed sense of smell, however they are unable to open up their eyes at first. This is why newborn puppies depend on their sense of smell in order to find their mother's teats, and to locate their littermates whenever they might get seperated. After about 9-11 days old, puppies open their eyes, however their retinas are poor and their vision is not as good as an adult dog. Also, puppies when are born, their ears remain sealed until about they are about 13-17 days old. And between 2-4 weeks old, puppies exhibit a lot of the normal behaviors of a dog such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Growling</li>
               <li>Biting</li>
                <li>Wagging their tails</li>
                <li>Barking</li>  
            </ul>
